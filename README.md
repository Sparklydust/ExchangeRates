### Starter

Start the project using Xcode 11.

Add your API key of the https://currencylayer.com/ website in the Xcode project following this path: 

- ExchangeRates project folder
- SupportingFiles
- NetworkIronFX.plist

- apiKey
- currencylayer

Your api key must be added to the empty value of the currencylayer key.

(My api key has been hidden using .gitignore, if you need it, send me a message via my contact details.)
